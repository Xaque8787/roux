## Email Delivery Issue - Diagnosis

Current setup:
- Verified domain in Resend: reports.pospiros.pizza
- Email sending from: reports@reports.pospiros.pizza
- Recipient: zacharyfive@gmail.com
- Status: API returns success, but email not received

## The Problem

When you verified `reports.pospiros.pizza` in Resend, you can ONLY send emails from addresses like:
- anything@reports.pospiros.pizza ✓
- noreply@reports.pospiros.pizza ✓
- kitchen@reports.pospiros.pizza ✓

But you're trying to send from:
- reports@reports.pospiros.pizza ✗ (subdomain OF subdomain)

This doesn't match your verified domain!

## Why It Shows "Success"

1. Resend API accepts the request (returns 200 OK)
2. But email providers (Gmail) reject it during delivery
3. DNS records don't match, so it's flagged as potential spam/spoofing
4. The email is silently dropped or bounced

## Solutions (Pick One)

### Option 1: Fix the email address to match verified domain (QUICKEST)

Change your `.env` to:
```bash
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@reports.pospiros.pizza
```

or

```bash
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=kitchen@reports.pospiros.pizza
```

The key is: Use `@reports.pospiros.pizza` (what you verified)
NOT: `@reports.reports.pospiros.pizza`

### Option 2: Verify the base domain instead (RECOMMENDED)

This is cleaner and more professional:

1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter: `pospiros.pizza` (your base domain)
4. Copy the DNS records
5. Add them to Cloudflare
6. Wait for verification (usually minutes)
7. Update `.env`:
```bash
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=reports@pospiros.pizza
```

This way you can use any email like:
- reports@pospiros.pizza
- kitchen@pospiros.pizza
- noreply@pospiros.pizza

## Check Delivery Status

1. Go to https://resend.com/emails
2. Find the email you just sent
3. Look at the status column
4. Click on it to see why it failed

You'll likely see:
- "Bounced"
- "Rejected"
- Or stuck in "Queued"

## After Making Changes

1. Update `.env` file
2. Restart your application
3. Try sending a test report
4. Check your Gmail inbox AND spam folder
5. Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
